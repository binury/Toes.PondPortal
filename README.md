# Pond Portal

_Embrace chaos and **dive** into the pond to teleport to another dimension..._

## Settings

```py
var default_config := {
     # When allowMature is true, Pond Portal permits going to servers marked as mature
     # They are otherwise excluded from the pool of lobby candidates, by default
    "allowMature": false
}
```

## Changelog

## 1.2.1

- Added portal sound effects
- Changed portal to only activate in lake/ponds
- Fixed mature lobby setting defaulting to true (sorry!)
